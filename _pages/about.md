Hi, I am an AI Researcher, passionate about research on autonomous, adaptive AI agents for asymmetric environments that personalize at test‑time, with a focus on privacy, learning from limited feedback, dynamic memory systems, and maintaining diverse, uncorrelated behaviors. 

I was fortunate to be advised by Professor Manuela Veloso and Professor Tucker Balch at J.P.Morgan AI Research. At Johns Hopkins University, I was fortunate to be supervised by Professor Scott Smith, where I graduated with a Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Computer Science. I am currently an AI Research Scientist at Millennium Management. In my free time, I love to bake (I am pretty good at baking sticky toffee pudding) and cook (I can make kimchi!).
